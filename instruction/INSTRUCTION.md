# Open-world refactoring kata

## Todo

* [ ] Open an editor or prepare piece of paper for taking notes

## Keep an eye on:

- inject stuff not only dependencies
- DRY but AHA
- SLAP
- SRP
- separate code that supports different actors
- look for cohesion, avoid coupling
- standard cleaning methods - segregate imports, destructure props, add missing prop types

## Exercise 1 - Extract Home feature

> Example

The goal of this and few following exercises is to clean up the code by extracting feature folders.

It'll help us group features based on how we see them in the UI.

Keep the reducers intact for now.

Bonus points for applying standard cleaning methods: segregate imports, descturcutre props, add missing prop types.

## Exercise 2 - Extract Article feature

Keep the reducers intact for now.

## Exercise 3 - Extract Editor feature

Keep the reducers intact for now.

## Exercise 4 - Move the Article reducer to the Article feature

> Example

The goal of this exercise is to move the article reducer to where it belongs - to the Article feature.

Keep an eye on hints üí° in `ArticleActions.js`, `Article/index.js`, `common.js` reducer.

1. Add `store` folder inside the Article feature
2. Add `actionTypes` to the `store` folder, extract actions that are used only in this feature from the common actions
3. Rename `DELETE_ARTICLE` action to `ROOT_REDIRECT`
4. Introduce generic `PAGE_UNLOADED` action in the `common.js` reducer

## Exercise 5 - Move the Editor reducer to the Editor feature

The goal is the same as above.

Keep an eye on hints üí° in `Editor.js` and `editor.js` reducer.

1. Add `store` folder inside the Editor feature
2. Add `actionTypes` to the `store` folder, extract actions that are used only in this feature from the common actions
3. Use common actions extracted earlier like `PAGE_UNLOADED`.

## Exercise 6 - Add `index.js` to the Article and Editor features

> Example

The goal of this exercise is to create a gateway - a public interface for each feature. This should be the only file that is imported in other parts of the application like router setup and so on.

1. Extract `Article.js` file and move the contents of  `index.js` there.
2. Export Article component and reducer from the index file.
3. Add `index.js` file for Editor feature.
4. Export Editor component and reducer from the index file.

## Exercise 7 - Add `Article.container`

> Example

The goal of this exercise is to clean up the Article component and remove all stuff related to Redux.

You will SLAP the code, inject stuff and see how to segregate responsibilities.

1. Create `Article.container.js` file and move all redux-related stuff there.
2. Pass necessary props.

## Exercise 8 - Add `Editor.container`

The goal is the same as in the previous exercise.

1. Create `Article.container.js` file and move all redux-related stuff there.
2. Pass necessary props.

## Exercise 9 - Remove `agent` from the `Article.js`

> Example

The goal of this exercise is to get rid of agent import in the Article component. It shouldn't be concerned about api calls.

1. Move `agent` up to the `Article.container` component.
2. (optional but recommended) Do the same for `Editor` component.

This is how `componentWillMount` should look like in the `Article` component:

```js
componentWillMount() {
  const articleId = this.props.match.params.id;
  this.props.fetchArticle(articleId);
}
```

## Exercise 10 - SLAP it - extract ArticleBody component

The goal of this task is to get rid of the `marked` dependency in the Article component and SLAP it a little bit more. This is just to show that those components can be really easy to read thanks to those small refactors.

1. Replace `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup}></div>` with `<ArticleBody body={article.body} />`

## Exercise 11 - Destructure props in Article component (you will need that later)

The goal of this task is to become a little bit more prepared for the hooks refactor that is coming.

Also it cleans up the component interface. There is one place where you see what props are used where (mainly in the `render` method).

## Exercise 12 - Move ArticleMeta to shared components and inject ArticleActions with props

## Exercise 13 - Use ArticleMeta in ArticlePreview

## Exercise 14 (optional) - Extract FieldTab component in `Home/MainView.js`

## Exercise 15 - Extract separate api for Home, Article and Editor features

## Exercise 16 - Extract routing module

The components shouldn't know we use `react-router-dom`.

When you finish ask me for a special halloween exercise. üëª

## Exercise 17 - Refactor Article component to Hooks

It's good to have destructured props now. Isn't it?

## Exercise 18 - Refactor CommentInput to Hooks

## Exercise 19 - Add `@testing-library/react` and test Article lifecycle

`should fetch articles on mount and cleanup on unmount`

## Exercise 20 - Refactor Register componentn to Hooks

## Exercise 21 - Create `useForm` hook and use in Register component

Get rid of redux calls to keep the form state in the store. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hint: you need to add `name` property to each form input.

## Exercise 22 - Create `withProSubscriptionOnly` HoC

Use the HoC to show "favorite" button on article preview only if the use has pro subscription.

## Exercise 23 - Discuss - why `withProSubscriptionOnly` is a HoC, wouldn't it be better if it was a Hook?
